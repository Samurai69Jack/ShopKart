# ShopKart

A proper E commerce website that allows users to signup login, search through different categories of products, view them, add them to cart and checkout, the functionality also includes a direct buy now that directly takes user to checkout and bypasses the carting system.

The different models involved in it are Product, Cart, OrderPlaced, UserProfile that have different relations mapped among them that allows users to have multiple addresses and profiles, also included proper password reset and forgot password functionality

I am looking to make more changes in this project in the coming days like integrating a payment gateway and also working on improving the UI
